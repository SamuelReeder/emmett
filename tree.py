# want a file to contain the path logic of the game
# ie have states in the game as nodes in graphs connected by edges where they can be accessed from
# based on logic choose which ones to access

# i can give a more clear implementation of this based on your requirements or what you would like

class Node:
    self.edges = []
    self.data = None
    

root = Node()
# root.edges.append(Node().data = "second")
